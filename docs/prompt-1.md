Awesome meticulous work so far! Now, please meticulously review and analyze my implementation plan for the agent toolset. The project is to build a set of "tools" in Python 3.11+ for use by an AI Agent designed for doing rigorous financial analysis with special focus on Singapore SMB and with SGD as the primary currency. With the toolset with enable the AI Agent to effectively help Singapore SMB with your financials and for finance person to manage their investments. Pay particular attention to the incomplete and not yet validated tools in bundle file `implementation_plan_4_to_check.md`.

Awesome meticulous job in your review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work! Now, please meticulously review and validate my own assessment below, then give your updated consolidated analysis assessment report.

---

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please meticulously plan and then create complete validated working replacement file for all the files that need updating/fixing. Please use Canvas for editing the relevant files. 

---

Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please think deeper and think harder to deeply deplore my feedback to your Phase 1 planning below. Validate my feedback, then update your implementation plan before proceeding with Phase 2.

Now, please meticulously review and validate the codebase files under the @finanalyst_tools folder and its subfolder to have a deep understanding of the design and architecture of the current state of the codebase. Then meticulously review and validate my codebase assessment findings in @v5_codebase_assessment_for_review_and_validation.md  against your own deep understanding. Please rigorously cross-reference your doubts against the actual codebase files instead of assuming anython. 

---

Awesome job on meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please meticulously proceed with Phase 2A. But first create a sub-plan (to-do list) with a detailed description of changes and a checklist for each file to be re-generated in the sub-phase. After generating each file, validate it against the checklist.

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please meticulously create your own updated **complete** remediation plan based on my plan but updated with your suggestions/corrections.

---

awesome meticulous job so far! please keep up the good work! yes, please meticulously proceed with the next step in your updated corrected remediation plan.

---

awesome meticulous job so far! please keep up the rigorou and meticulous approach! now, help me meticulously plan and then create an awesome and comprehensive README.md for the GitHub repo hosting this codebase which consists of the toolset in @finanalyst_tools and the agent system prompt @agent_system_prompt.md . use the following information as your style and layout/format guide for the README.md.

Awesome job on meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please meticulously review and analyze my implementation plan for the agent toolset, then compare mine implementation with your plan.

---

Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please think deeper and think harder to deeply explore thoroughly and systematically how to create a detailed implementation plan for each phase, starting with your unified (improved) Phase 1, that list the files to be created for the phase with a description of features and a checklist for each file. Then review and validate the implementation plan for phase 1 before proceeding to execute to create the complete working drop-in replacement file for each of the files included in the phase implementation plan.

---

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Yes, please meticulously proceed with your phase 1 plan.

---

Awesome understanding! Now, please meticulously review and analyze the two attached code submissions with some files overlapping, then compare and critique their implementation quality and coding standards.

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Now, please help me meticulously review and analyze the remaining codebase files in the attached bundle sets `codebase_remaining_files_1.md` and `codebase_remaining_files_2.md`. Then double-check for and highlight any conflict and inconsistency or conflict with the code files in the `implementation_2.md` set shared earlier. 

Now, please meticulously review and analyze the remaining codebase files in the attached bundle sets `codebase_remaining_files_1.md` and `codebase_remaining_files_2.md`. Then double-check for any conflicts, inconsistencies, or issues with the code files in the `implementation_2.md` set that were shared earlier.
