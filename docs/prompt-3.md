Awesome job on meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Yes, please meticulously proceed with your updated "Phase 2 using the corrected, codebase-accurate implementation plan.”

But first create a sub-plan (to-do list) with a detailed description of changes and a checklist for each file to be re-generated in the sub-phase. After generating each file, validate it against the checklist.

Remember to create complete validated working replacement file for all the files that need updating/fixing. Please use Canvas for editing the relevant files.

Awesome understanding! please meticulously review and analyze the two attached sample `README.md` for GitHub repos, then create a prompt to get ChatGPT or any LLM to generate similarly structured `README.md` based on given repo codebase. So analyze the structure, layout, format, style, design and other nuances of the attached sample files, then come up with a structured guide as a LLM prompt template.

Awesome understanding! Now, please meticulously review and analyze the codebase files attached below. Due to the length, I will share the codebase files in this and the next two prompts. Wait for me to tell you that all the codebase files have been uploaded before you begin your consolidated review and analysis.

Awesome job on meticulous analysis, planning and execution! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please think deeper and think harder to deeply explore thoroughly and systematically how best to re-imagine a complete working drop-in replacement file for all files that need updating to incorporate your suggested improvements/fixes. Then meticulously create an implementation plan to create the complete working replacement files for all files that need fixing/rework, include in your plan an integrated checklist for each file. Review and validate your implementation plan before proceeding meticulously to execute it. Make sure you generate a working replacement file with no placeholder comments.
