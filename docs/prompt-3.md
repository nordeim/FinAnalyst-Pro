Awesome job on meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Yes, please meticulously proceed with your updated "Phase 2 using the corrected, codebase-accurate implementation plan.”

But first create a sub-plan (to-do list) with a detailed description of changes and a checklist for each file to be re-generated in the sub-phase. After generating each file, validate it against the checklist.

Remember to create complete validated working replacement file for all the files that need updating/fixing. Please use Canvas for editing the relevant files.

Awesome understanding! please meticulously review and analyze the two attached sample `README.md` for GitHub repos, then create a prompt to get ChatGPT or any LLM to generate similarly structured `README.md` based on given repo codebase. So analyze the structure, layout, format, style, design and other nuances of the attached sample files, then come up with a structured guide as a LLM prompt template.
